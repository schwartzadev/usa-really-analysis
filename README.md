# Data Analysis on *USA Really*
Data analysis using AI to identify information about *[USA Really](https://usareally.com/)*, a [Russian state-operated](https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/national-security/article212299529.html) [news site](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/man-running-russia-s-newest-propaganda-effort-u-s-or-n883736) marketed towards Americans.

## Methodology

### Classification Model

The model that I used for this project is based on the Twitter data and scripts created by [nisarg64 and is available on GitHub](https://github.com/nisarg64/Sentiment-Analysis-NLTK).

### Data Gathering

The `get_media_data.py` file in the root directory contains the code needed to compile the database yourself.
As is clear in the file, this uses an internal API that USA Really uses to load content on its site.
